# **📝 NOTEPAD--**
> *"The only text editor that values its own advertisements more than your data."*

Why use a modern IDE or a fast text editor when you can use **NOTEPAD--**? This is a line-by-line Batch-based text editor designed to maximize user frustration through artificial latency and aggressive project cross-promotion.

## **🚀 Features**
* **The "Saving" Tax**: For every single line of text you enter, the script forces you to wait through a (infinite)-cycle spinner loop.It even admits its own incompetence: `saving(idk if it's saving or not)...`.
* **Integrated Adware**: Before you can start a file, you are greeted with a mandatory ASCII billboard for `run.cmd`. 
* **Forced "Nightmare" Integration**: If you accidentally agree to the ad, the script will immediately `curl` the `run.cmd` "Nightmare Edition" from GitHub and save it to your local directory.
* **Destructive Initialization**: The script starts by using `type nul > %a%`, which instantly wipes any existing file with the same name before you've even typed a word[cite: 28].
* **Infinite Append**: There is no "Save and Exit." You are stuck in a loop entering lines (`Line 1`, `Line 2`, etc.) until you manually kill the process or exit via the initial ad prompt.

## **🕹️ Usage**
1. **Name Your File**: Enter the filename and extension.
2. **Survive the Ad**: Decide if you want to download the "Nightmare Edition" of `run.cmd`.
3. **Write (Slowly)**: Type your text line by line. After every line, enjoy a mandatory meditation break while the "saving" spinner runs.

## **🛠️ Internal Logic**
* **Line Counter**: Controlled by variable `%aa%`.
* **Latency Engine**: Uses `ping 127.0.0.1 -n 1 -w 10 >nul` to simulate work.
* **Ecosystem Bridge**: Uses `curl` to ensure you never go a day without the `run.cmd` "war crime" on your hard drive.
